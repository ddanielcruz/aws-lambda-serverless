# Amazon Cognito

[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) is a service provided by AWS used to handle user management, authentication and authorization. It handle sign in, sign up and other common flows with built in user interfaces, similar to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

It has basic user and password authentication, but also supports **social identity providers**, such as Google and Facebook, and **enterprise identify providers** via **SAML 2.0** and **OpenID Connect**. Also, using the identity pool the user can get temporary access to an AWS service, being able to interact with a service authorized by the session.
